+Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different. Here it goes.  
+I'm the kind of guy who has been called as both an introvert and an extrovert. I love to sit in my room and just have some time with myself. But i also like to roam around with my gang. I read alot of books, always ready for a game of fifa and i like my late night walks with my bestie. Basicaaly, I don't belong to particular category. I am a bit of this and bit of that.  
+I doubt you will find anything interesting in my timeline s()ice I'm not really into facebook or other social networks but you can check it out here: [my timeline](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100010478928366)
